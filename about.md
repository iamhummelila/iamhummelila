## About me!

I am [@iamhummelila](https://github.com/iamhummelila)! I am studying computational linguistics aka NLP and comparative literature at uni.
Of course, I'm not learning Python for literature (a little project there might be fun though!), but for CL / NLP.

My interests are widespread, so I'll stick to the basics: I love (natural) languages, explaining things, holding small speeches (or monologues) on things that fascinate me, and, of course, learning information. My brain is like a sponge. I want to get all the info in my head. Then, my brain is like a sieve: I forget all of it again.

So, what am I learning at the moment, besides uni-related-stuff?
- Python! (for uni, but also for personal projects)
- CSS and HTML (for this website! so kind of for uni and for personal projects)
- also, basic markdown and LaTeX.
- Languages. I speak five languages more or less fluently, and want to learn another five asap. I do have a list.

I wish I could list more, but that's it for the now. Have fun!

It doesn't matter if you're straight, gay, bisexual, or asexual.

At the end of the day, its night.

Haha, you really thought you could get away without another dad joke? Hahaha. Now that's a good joke.
