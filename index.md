## Welcome to my Github Page!

This is my first Github Page!

I will try my best to upload some samples of my `code` here.

About me:
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [@iamhummelila](https://iamhummelila.github.io/iamhummelila/)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python at university, where I am studying computational linguistics.
- Funfact: a year ago, I did not like programming. Now? FUN. Takes some getting used to!

Since I am still at uni, I'm currently working through old exams. _Don't wanna fail!_ You'll find one of those tasks under the following link:

[Recipe task](https://github.com/iamhummelila/recipe_task)

You may also use the recipes in this repository. I take no responsibility, especially since I have not tried them either.

Of course, there will be more tasks!

I am also going to link this Markdown Cheatsheet here so both you and I can find it easily: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

On a very random sidenote: I have not yet figured out how or if people can contact each other directly through Github. So if you do know, just contact me and I hope I'll find that.
