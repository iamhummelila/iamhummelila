## Welcome to my Github Page!

This is my first Github Page!

I will try my best to upload some samples of my `code` here.

About me:
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [@iamhummelila](https://iamhummelila.github.io/iamhummelila/)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python at university, where I am studying computational linguistics.

Since I am still at uni, I'm currently working through old exams. Don't wanna fail! You'll find one of those tasks under the following link:

[Recipe task](https://github.com/iamhummelila/recipe_task)
You may also use the recipes in this repository. I take no responsibility, I have not tried them.

Of course, there will be more.
