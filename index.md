## Welcome to my Github Page!

This is my first Github Page!

I will try my best to upload some samples of my `code` here.

[About me](about.md):
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [@iamhummelila](https://iamhummelila.github.io/iamhummelila/)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python at university, where I am studying computational linguistics.
- Funfact: a year ago, I did not like programming. Now? FUN. Takes some getting used to!

Since I am still at uni, I'm currently working through old exams. _Don't wanna fail!_ You'll find two of those tasks under the following links:

[Recipe task](https://github.com/iamhummelila/recipe_task)

[Extraction task](https://github.com/iamhummelila/extraction_task)

You may also use the recipes in the first repository. I take no responsibility, especially since I have not tried them either.

Of course, there will be more tasks!

I am also going to link this Markdown Cheatsheet here so both you and I can find it easily: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

This is not the only potentially useful link on this website, as I created a whole different list! You can find it [here](links.md).
