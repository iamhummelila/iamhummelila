## Mini Exercises

So my good friend was thinking about their future and, helpful as I am, I suggested to start learning to program. After all, if you put the work and effort in it, you can get a job, probably.
(Naturally, I had no personal agenda like 'more people in NLP!' or 'yas more people _like me_ in IT!')

There are tons and tons of resources that help you with learning what stuff there is. So I'm not going to do this. Maybe I'll link some things, maybe I'll do a "this is how I learned" site later on.
What I decided to do for my friend however is a list of small exercises so they could practise basics.
Programming can be really annoying (I'm talking error handling) and hard and I want to offer a quick-dopamine-gateway for my fellow neurodivergent people.

At first, install any IDE. I use Visual Studio Code. Many people who study with me use PyCharm. I also used to code with Spyder, but... I do not recommend.
If you're already familiar with Linux and similar stuff, you can just pip install python3 and then type python3. But if you're already familiar with Linux, idk how much help you'll need.

If you have question about the IDE, first try googling it, watching 100 YouTube videos on it, and if none of your friends program (or you have no friends), you can try to send me a mail at my informal e-mail address.

I'd also suggest you look up what pseudo code is. Whenever you realise you cannot do the exercises easily, write some pseudo code with a pencil.


#### The small exercises are as follows:

1. print "Hello World" to the console. This must be your first program. It's like a (nerd) rule.
2. Assing a meaning to two variables. Then, swap the meaning. (i.e. from defining a = "xxx" and b = "yyy", change it to b = "xxx" and a = "yyy") You are not allowed to just reassign it.
3. Assign a list (of stuff you still have left as to dos) to a variable. Use a for loop to print each of them separately. 
4. Extra credit! Use range() and enumerate() to _enumerate_ the list.
5. Another extra credit! Use an F-string to do exactly what I told you to do in step 4. If you need a tip: Google. Or check that [Helpful Link NTM](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)
6. EXTRA CREDIT (again)! Include an if / else condition to the for loop. Like, print some things, and ignore others.
7. While loops! First, break it. Write a never-ending while loop. It should throw a RunTimeError.
8. Write a while loop that does not break.
9. Fun Break! If you havent up until now, learn how to write pseudo code. Sometimes you have time to think about scripts, but no battery. Pseudo code is nice for planning code.
10. Iterate over a list. If they're strings, add them to a string list. If they're numbers, add them to a number list. Else, add them to a random list.
11. Create a random dictionary and print its values with a for loop. Play around until you feel comfortable with dictionaries.
12. Look for the coordinates of your favorite places. You can choose three. If you dont know anything about coordinates, just choose a random number. Put them in a tuple.
13. You have tuples, yes? Get them to a dictionary. The keys are your favourite places, the coordinate tuples are the values.
14. Remember exercise number 4? Consider the number the ID of the todo. Create a dictionary, where the ID is the key and the to do is the value.
15. Back to exercise 10: How do we go about this exercise, if we want everything in the list to be unique? (Tip: We've looked at lists, tuples, and dictionaries. How else can we store data?
16. While loops: Ask for an input() and check it with a predefined password.

This has been relatively easy so far, which really is the point. If you run into problems, you can always send an email at my e-mail, or ask a question on Stackoverflow. Be sure to Google first though.

If you feel comfortable with all the exercises above, let's move on.


#### Functions

17. Look at the code you've already written. Choose the thing you feel most comfortable with (or just the first thing) and create a function.
18. If you need more practise with writing function, re-write all your code to a function. If you accidentally deleted it: No worries. You can write it again - better. even.
19. Next step: Create a main() function that just executes the functions you defined.
20. Final tip. Add the following to your program: if __name__ == "__main__": main()
21. Write some more funny functions!


#### Classes

We'll be using 'cars' here. If you could not care less about cars, you may also decide to do it for animals, make-up, books, or random foods. Whatever you love the most.

22. Create a class called "Car" and make up some attributes and methods. It's okay if the methods only print stuff.
23. Create a new class that inherits from the class "Car". This class is about some random car type - like maybe a Jaguar or a VW, I really dont care.
24. Create a class "Car Store" that can store car objects.


Now, I am tired and might add some other things later. But for the now, these are just things that you should get into by the time you feel comfortable with everything above.

- Errors and exception handling (try-except - this thing)
- List, set, and dictionary comprehensions.
- Get informed on modules like numpy, pandas, seaborn, nltk, ...
