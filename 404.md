But if you're here already, I have yet a horrible dad joke [^note] for you: 

What happened after the daughter came out as trans to her parents?

They became trans-parent.

[^note:]
Why do I have two trans-child-dad-jokes on my website?

Simple! I like trans people, and I like horrible jokes. If I find or think of any more inclusive dad jokes, you'll probably find them here. Or you just send them to my informal e-mail-address.
